  1. Theories
  2. Laws
  3. Experiments
3. Answer

- From an observation comes a hypothesis.

### Hypothesis

- A tentative explanation for the original observation, or a prediction.

### Experiments

- Must follow procedures, to ensure correct results.

### Results

- If the results of experiments do not match the original hypothesis, revise it.
- If the results of experiments *do* match the original hypothesis, you've contributed to the body of knowledge.

### Further Testing

- Helps to determine whether your hypothesis is genuinely correct or not.

#### Doesn't Support Hypothesis

- Attempt to determine what went wrong with your original experiment, to avoid the same mistake.
- Remake your original hypothesis.

#### Does Support Hypothesis

- You can come up with a theory, which is an explanation for why the hypothesis is true.
