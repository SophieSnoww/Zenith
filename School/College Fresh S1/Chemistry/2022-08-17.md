## Matter

- Matter is anything that takes up space and has mass
- Three main states
  - Solid
  - Liquid
  - Gas
- Less common states
  - Plasma

- Mass is a measurement of how much matter is in an object
- Weight changes depending on gravity

### Subcategories of Matter

#### Pure Substances

- If you can break it down into more simple substances, it's a compound
- If you can, it's an element

##### Elements

- Made of atoms
- Atoms bond to form molecules

#### Mixtures

- If the composition varies from point to point, its a heterogenious mixture
- If it doesn't, it's a homogeneous mixute
  - Also called a solution

### Conservation of Matter

There is no detectable change in the quantity of matter present when matter changes from one form to another.

### Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter

#### Physical Properties

- Color
- Malleability
- Viscosity
- Texture
- Density
- Conductivity
- Melting/boiling point

- Most physical properties can be observed without change

#### Chemical Properties

- Reactivity
- Flammability
- Toxicity
- Acidity
- Radioactivity

- Changing chemical properties usually means a change in identity

### Measurements

- Size and magnitude
- Comparison & standard
- Indication of uncertainty
