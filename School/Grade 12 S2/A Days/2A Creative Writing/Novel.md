## Chapter 1

Teir'in, Ol'koa, and Aer'tera scoured the landscape around them. The trio had been travelling all day, which certainly wasn't abnormal, but they had decided to take an extra arduous journey today. They didn't have much to focus on, so they chose to continue filling the map they had - one of their prized possessions, as with all sa'kai families. The sun was beginning to rise, and as the sky gradually lightened, they began looking for somewhere to spend the night.

"Oh, there! That looks nice!" Aer'tera said, in their particularly musical voice. They gestured to a little spot of flat ground amidst the jungle-like forest around them.

"Good eye, Aer," Ol'koa stated as the three of them made their way over. They all fell into their usual routine; Teir'in gathered materials to start a fire, Ol'koa unpacked what they'd need for the night, and Aer'tera searched the nearby forest for anything interesting, or dangerous. It wasnt long before they were all settled down, Aer'tera cooking a meal over the fire while the other two relaxed.

"Today was definitely harder than our usual travel," Ol'koa said as they stretched out. "We can take it easy tomorrow, if you two prefer."

"I honestly enjoy the more intense days. Seeing all the sights and getting to chart new locations is really exciting, I think," Teir'in responded as they gazed up at the brightening sky. Aer'tera nodded their agreement as they added a few spices to the stew simmering over the fire. "Though, obviously, we couldn't do that every night."

Teir'in woke before the other two, as they normally would. They enjoyed watching the sunset and feeling the air cool off a little, and this evening was no different. They stood up, stretched, ruffled their feathers, and started wandering through the forest towards an outcropping they had seen last night. They found it before too long, finding a nice place to sit and relax. They sat and watched as the sun slipped below the horizon, the sky darkening and filling with stars. It was easy to lose track of time, but that's exactly what they enjoyed doing - it's not like there was anything else they needed to do.

Teir'in jolted to attention when they felt a rush of air, like a small shockwave, accompanied by what sounded like a yelp of pain. They stood up, peering over the ledge they were resting on and into the forest below. In a small glade, it looked like there was an injured animal with a dark figure looming over it. Teir'in leaped off of the outcropping, gliding down and approaching the figures carefully.

As they approached, Teir'in lost sight of the dark figure. They hadn't looked away, it was just... gone. Teir'in stopped for a moment, looking around and getting even more wary. After a few moments passed with nothing changing, they ventured further forwards and stepped into the clearing. Now that they were closer, the hurt creature looked like a sa'kai. They were hurt badly, bleeding from a large gash across their abdomen.

"Oh! Oh no, no no no, what'd they do!?" Teir'in could barely get words out as they stepped closer, kneeling next to the sa'kai. "Hold on, hang on, I can get help..." Teir'in wanted to help, but knew that there was no surviving a gash that deep.

"Stay..." the sa'kai gasped, clearly in pain. "Someone must... witness..."

"I'm so sorry, I want to help..! I just..-" Teir'in felt like they could barely get words out. They didn't even want to touch the injured sa'kai, afraid that they might just make their pain worse.

"You must...-" The injured sa'kai coughed, spitting up blood. They spoke softly, and Teir'in leaned down to hear. "You must kill them..."

"Who? I'll... I'll help however I can..!" Teir'in spoke equally soft, trying to comfort the dying sa'kai however they could.

"The dark figure... Ka'zitik. That's..- That's its name..." The sa'kai spoke even quieter, and Teir'in couldn't help but tear up, knowing they were witnessing someone die right in front of them. "Kill them... and then, only then... will you be truly free."

"I-" Teir-in had to hold back tears. "I'll- I'll do whatever it takes. To avenge you..."

The sa'kai smiled gently, closing their eyes. They gave out a gasp of pain, took a long, shaky breath, and went limp. Teir'in couldn't do anything but close their eyes, their tears falling onto the feathers of the dead sa'kai in front of them. They didn't even know the sa'kai, and it would probably take a lot of discussion with the other two to puzzle out what they meant, but... Teir'in felt strangely compelled to help, however they could.

Suddenly, Teir'in felt white-hot. They opened their eyes in shock, but saw nothing but white. They heard an explosion so loud they wanted to claw their ears off, and felt themself get tossed backwards, still only seeing white. Teir'in hit the ground hard, their entire body feeling like it had electricity coursing through it, tensing every muscle, and lost consciousness.
