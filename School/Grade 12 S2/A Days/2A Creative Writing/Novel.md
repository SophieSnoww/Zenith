Teir'in, Ol'koa, and Aer'tera scoured the landscape around them. The trio had been travelling all day, which certainly wasn't abnormal, but they had decided to take an extra arduous journey today. They didn't have much to focus on, so they chose to continue filling the map they had - one of their prized possessions, as with all sa'kai families. The sun was beginning to rise, and as the sky gradually lightened, they began looking for somewhere to spend the night.

"Oh, there! That looks nice!" Aer'tera said, in their particularly musical voice. They gestured to a little spot of flat ground amidst the jungle-like forest around them.

"Good eye, Aer," Ol'koa stated as the three of them made their way over. They all fell into their usual routine; Teir'in gathered materials to start a fire, Ol'koa unpacked what they'd need for the night, and Aer'tera searched the nearby forest for anything interesting, or dangerous. It wasnt long before they were all settled down, Aer'tera cooking a meal over the fire while the other two relaxed.

"Today was definitely harder than our usual travel," Ol'koa said as they stretched out. "We can take it easy tomorrow, if you two prefer."

"I honestly enjoy the more intense days. Seeing all the sights and getting to chart new locations is really exciting, I think," Teir'in responded as they gazed up at the brightening sky. Aer'tera nodded their agreement as they added a few spices to the stew simmering over the fire. "Though, obviously, we couldn't do that every night."

Teir'in woke before the other two, as they normally would. They enjoyed watching the sunset and feeling the air cool off a little, and this evening was no different. They stood up, stretched, ruffled their feathers, and started wandering through the forest towards an outcropping they had seen last night. They found it before too long, finding a nice place to sit and relax. They sat and watched as the sun slipped below the horizon, the sky darkening and filling with stars. It was easy to lose track of time, but that's exactly what they enjoyed doing - it's not like there was anything else they needed to do.

Teir'in jolted to attention when they felt a rush of air, like a small shockwave, accompanied by what sounded like a yelp of pain. They stood up, peering over the ledge they were resting on and into the forest below. In a small glade, it looked like there was an injured animal with a dark figure looming over it. Teir'in leaped off of the outcropping, gliding down and approaching the figures carefully.

As they approached, Teir'in lost sight of the dark figure. They hadn't looked away, it was just... gone. Teir'in stopped for a moment, looking around and getting even more wary. After a few moments passed with nothing changing, they ventured further forwards and stepped into the clearing. Now that they were closer, the hurt creature looked like a sa'kai. They were hurt badly, bleeding from a large gash across their abdomen.

"Oh! Oh no, no no no, what'd they do!?" Teir'in could barely get words out as they stepped closer, kneeling next to the sa'kai. "Hold on, hang on, I can get help..." Teir'in wanted to help, but knew that there was no surviving a gash that deep.

"Stay..." the sa'kai gasped, clearly in pain. "Someone must... witness..."

"I'm so sorry, I want to help..! I just..-" Teir'in felt like they could barely get words out. They didn't even want to touch the injured sa'kai, afraid that they might just make their pain worse.

"You must...-" The injured sa'kai coughed, spitting up blood. They spoke softly, and Teir'in leaned down to hear. "You must kill them..."

"Who? I'll... I'll help however I can..!" Teir'in spoke equally soft, trying to comfort the dying sa'kai however they could.

"The dark figure... Ka'zitik. That's..- That's its name..." The sa'kai spoke even quieter, and Teir'in couldn't help but tear up, knowing they were witnessing someone die right in front of them. "Kill them... and then, only then... will you be truly free."

"I-" Teir'in had to hold back tears. "I'll- I'll do whatever it takes. To avenge you..." It felt strange that they were so determined to help this sa'kai they had never met before, but... Teir'in couldn't help but feel a sense of duty.

The sa'kai smiled gently, closing their eyes. They gave out a gasp of pain, took a long, shaky breath, and went limp. Teir'in couldn't do anything but close their eyes, their tears falling onto the feathers of the dead sa'kai in front of them. They didn't even know the sa'kai, and it would probably take a lot of discussion with the other two to puzzle out what they meant, but... Teir'in felt strangely compelled to help, however they could.

Suddenly, Teir'in felt white-hot. They opened their eyes in shock, but saw nothing but white. They heard an explosion so loud they wanted to claw their ears off, and felt themself get tossed backwards, still only seeing white. Teir'in hit the ground hard, their entire body feeling like it had electricity coursing through it, tensing every muscle, and lost consciousness.

---

Ol'koa and Aer'tera jolted awake as a loud explosion sounded relatively nearby. They quickly scrambled to their feet, ears perked up as they glanced around, ready for anything. After a few moments, they relaxed, but tensed up again when they realized Teir'in was gone.

"Teir'in!?" Ol'koa shouted, and they both waited for a response. When none came, they were even more worried.

"The explosion sounded like it was that way...!" Aer'tera said, looking worried.

"You're right. We just have to hope that Teir'in wasn't hurt..."

The two sa'kai cautiously walked in the direction of the sound, coming to a small outcropping of rock. From here, they could see the large expanse of forest below, and, very noticably, a circle of charred, uprooted, and flaming trees. Ol'koa gave Aer'tera a worried glance, and the two of them jumped off the ledge, gliding down towards the site of the explosion. They landed and ran through the forest towards it, and when they reached the clearing, they saw what they were fearing: Teir'in was laying face-down on the charred ground, unmoving. Strangely, though, Teir'in didn't look like they had just been through an explosion at all - they looked completely fine, if unconscious.

"Teir'in! Oh no, no no no..." Aer'tera ran and knelt beside Teir'in, looking them over. They gently nudged them. "Please wake up, please..."

Ol'koa stood back, looking around the clearing in shock. "How in the world did this happen...?" The clearing was entirely empty, if burnt.

"They're still breathing...!" Aer'tera spoke softly, as if being too loud would hurt Teir'in more. "Should we... take them back to camp...?"

"Yes. They don't look injured, so it should be safe to move them... Here, I'll carry them." Ol'koa walked over and gently picked up Teir'in, then led the way back to the camp.

The journey back to the camp felt like forever, even though it was really only a minute or two. Aer'tera couldn't help but check on Teir'in every few moments, but Ol'koa stood stoic as ever, trying not to let his worry show.

"They'll be okay," said Ol'koa as they stepped back into their little camp. The sun had set and it was quickly darkening, so Aer'tera started another small fire in the firepit from last night. Ol'koa gently lay Teir'in down on a blanket, and surveyed their body.

"They're still breathing fine... They're not even burnt, which, well, I'm very glad for, but it's very confusing." Ol'koa gently rolled Teir'in onto their side, checking their back, but saw nothing. "Their pulse is fine... I'm not sure we can do much but make sure their comfortable and just... wait."

Aer'tera looked worried, but knew that Ol'koa was right.

---

By midnight, Teir'in still hadn't woken up. Both Ol'koa and Aer'tera were worried, and they were checking Teir'ins pulse and breathing more and more often, but they couldn't think of anything else to do. Teir'in wasn't injured, no matter how you looked at it.

---

"Oh!" Aer'tera spoke suddenly, and pointed at Teir'in. "Look!"

"What? Where?" Ol'koa walked quickly over to Teir'in, looking worried. It didn't look like anything had changed.

"No, not Teir'in. Look beside them!" Ol'koa looked at where they were pointing, right by Teir'ins head. There were a few flowers and mushrooms that Ol'koa hadn't seen before, but Ol'koa wasn't exactly paying attention to the foliage when they were trying to help their hatchmate.

"The flowers? What about them?" Ol'koa sighed a little when they realized that Aer'tera was probably getting excited over nothing, though it did make them happy to see them happy.

"They weren't there before! I swear."

Ol'koa glanced skeptically back at the plants. "Just because we didn't notice them doesn't mean they weren't there."

"No, I swear, they-" Aer'tera suddenly gasped, and got up to kneel next to Teir'in. Ol'koa saw what they gasped at as they reached a talon forward and gently held a flower that appeared to be growing right in front of them. Neither of them had ever seen something grow that quickly, and after a few seconds, the flower was in full bloom.

"What..." Ol'koa didn't know what to think. They gently pick Teir'in up, moving them a few feet to the side. The plants just continued to bloom wherever Teir'in was, though Ol'koa shivered when they put Tier'in down. "It felt like... a large amount of energy. Holding them, I mean. Like they gave off energy."

They couldn't do much other than look in awe as Teir'in lay there, plants growing around them. Ol'koa gave Aer'tera a concerned look, but Aer'tera only shrugged in response.
