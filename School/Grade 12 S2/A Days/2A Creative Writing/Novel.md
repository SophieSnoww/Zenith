## Chapter 1

Teir'in, Ol'koa, and Aer'tera scoured the landscape around them. The trio had been travelling all day, which certainly wasn't abnormal, but they had decided to take an extra arduous journey today. They didn't have much to focus on, so they chose to continue filling the map they had. It was one of their prized possessions, as with all sa'kai families. The sun was beginning to rise, and as the sky gradually lightened, they began looking for somewhere to spend the night.

"Oh, there! That could be nice?" Aer'tera said, in their particularly musical voice. They gestured to a little spot of flat ground amidst the jungle-like forest around them.

"Good eye, Aer," Ol'koa stated as the three of them made their way over. They all fell into their usual routine; Teir'in gathered materials to start a fire, Ol'koa unpacked what they'd need for the night, and Aer'tera searched the nearby forest for anything interesting, or dangerous.
