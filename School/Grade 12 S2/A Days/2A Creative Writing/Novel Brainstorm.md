## Magic, Emotions, & Depression

### Plot

- Tribal life, foraging and wandering the frozen planet
  - Normal hunting scene to illustrate what life is normally like
  - Establish normal roles
    - [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] is the stereotypical smart one
      - Very book-smart type deal
    - [PLACEHOLDER][STANDOFFISH FRIEND] is a leader type, strong
      - Very up front but really cares about the other two when it all comes down to it
      - Protective
    - [PLACEHOLDER][GENTLE FRIEND] just wants to help but messes up a lot
      - Really enjoys more creative tasks, but just wants to help however they can
- Something (accident? otherwordly being?) gives [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] intense magic
  - ~~Crystal of pure energy?~~
    - ~~Meh~~
  - ~~Lightning or adjacent?~~
    - ~~Maybe not because this is more likely to just kill you. but I suppose this is fantasy, so whatever~~
  - Stumbles upon a dying/sleeping god?
    - Called [PLACEHOLDER][GOD]
    - The god isn't a stereotypical all-powerful and hostile being, it's timid and skittish, like a wild animal
    - Imbues the char with magic by accident, or out of fright?
      - Perhaps [PLACEHOLDER][GOD] is afraid of [PLACEHOLDER][EVIL], and as its last action before dying, transfers its immense magical power to [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE]
      - "Go, vanquish [PLACEHOLDER][EVIL]... only then will you be truly free"
    - [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] is discovered by the other two laying in the middle of what looks like an explosion, but they're completely unharmed, if unconscious
      - Maybe some cool descriptions with how ammonia-based life would interact with an explosion?
- Self-loathing because of seemingly uncontrollable, volatile, emotional magic
  - Accidentally hurts friends
    - "no, NO, this is NOT OKAY!" (explodes LOL)
    - Knocks [PLACEHOLDER][GENTLE FRIEND] unconscious
      - Perhaps gives them a scar too
  - Perhaps [PLACEHOLDER][STANDOFFISH FRIEND] gets upset at them about it
    - They have to put their whole effort into saving [PLACEHOLDER][GENTLE FRIEND] and waking them up again
      - [PLACEHOLDER][STANDOFFISH FRIEND] won't let [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] attempt to use magic to heal
        - It's too unpredictable, you might just kill her, we can't trust you, etc. etc.
    - [PLACEHOLDER][GENTLE FRIEND] convinces the upset friend to help
    - Big whole sequence about remembering past experiences with the [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE]
      - Include small things, flesh out the world, include those humanizing experiences
- Friends go to help remove magic, big journey
  - They all interpret what [PLACEHOLDER][GOD] said as them being able to remove the magic
  - Learns about magic, how to control it, how to use it for good
  - [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] has lots of inner conflict while they travel
- Big fight, [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] is almost brought back into their depression
  - They think killing [PLACEHOLDER][EVIL] will get rid of [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE]'s magic, but it doesn't.
    - And, at this point, [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] doesn't want to lose the magic
  - Fight against [PLACEHOLDER][EVIL], the thing that killed [PLACEHOLDER][GOD]
  - Need to come up with a reason that [PLACEHOLDER][EVIL] can't just kill them all easily
  - Seeing their friends in danger, [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] saves them all
  - Contains the evil within themself? Has to deal with that now?
- A return or jump forward to relatively returned-to-normal life, [PLACEHOLDER][MAGICAL ONE] having learned that their magic isn't inherently bad
