## Topics

### Magic, Emotions, & Depression

#### Plot

- Tribal life, foraging and wandering the frozen planet
  - Normal hunting scene to illustrate what life is normally like
- Something (accident? otherwordly being?) gives one of the main characters intense magic
  - Crystal of pure energy?
    - Meh
  - Lightning or adjacent?
    - Maybe not because this is more likely to just kill you. but I suppose this is fantasy, so whatever
  - Stumbles upon a sleeping god?
    - The god isn't a stereotypical all-powerful and hostile being, it's timid and skittish, like a wild animal
    - Imbues the char with magic by accident, or out of fright?
      - Perhaps the god is afraid of the evil being, and as its last action before dying, transfers its immense magical power to the char
- Self-loathing because of seemingly uncontrollable, volatile, emotional magic
- Friends go to help remove magic, big journey
  - Learns about magic, how to control it, how to use it for good
- Big fight, magical char is almost brought back into their depression
  - Seeing their friends in danger, magical char saves them all
  - Contains the evil within themself? Has to deal with that now?
- A return or jump forward to relatively returned-to-normal life, the magical char having learned that their magic isn't inherently bad
