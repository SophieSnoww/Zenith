# Worldbuilding questions

*from [SFWA](https://www.sfwa.org/2009/08/04/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/)*

## Basics

### **Are the laws of nature and physics actually different in this world, or are they the same as in real life? How does magic/technology fit in? How do magical beasts fit in?**

Laws of nature/physics are not different. Magic, however, does exist. There aren't really any 'magical beasts', all beings are logical and fit with our real-life science.

### **Is this generally an earth-like world? Is it an “alternate Earth”?**

No.

### **Are there different human races, whether or not there are non-humans like elves or dwarves? How does the cultural and ethnic diversity of this world compare to the real world?**

Humans do not exist on this world.

### **How long have there been people on this world? Did they evolve, or did they migrate from somewhere/when else?**

Similar to humans on earth, beings on this world evolved over millions of years. Probably slightly quicker than humans did, maybe on the scale of 3 million years instead of 6 million years. Something liek that.

### **How many people are there in this country? How does this compare with world population? What is considered a small town/large town/city in terms of number of people?**

'Countries', as *we* know them, do not exist. The world is fairly populous, lets say ~5 billion, however the planet is much larger than earth and tribes tend to be nomadic by nature.

### **Where does magic power come from: the gods, the “mana” of the world (as in Larry Niven’s “Warlock” stories), the personal willpower or life force of the magician, somewhere else? Is magic an exhaustible resource? If a magician must feed his spells with his own willpower, life-force, or sanity, what long-term effects will this have on the health and/or stability of the magician? Do different races/species have different sources for their magic, or does everybody use the same one?**

Magic is based on actual endurance. The amount of energy required to lift a boulder magically would be the same amount of energy required to actually lift that boulder. Extremely well-practiced magicials can build up natural endurance, the same as working out, but a few members of the population are naturally blessed with magic - it is unknown why. Possibly a recessive gene. This leads to many population centers having one main magician that ends up being their leader.

### **Where does technology come from? Is it readily available to the general population, or is it usable only by an elite group?**

Technology isn't very widely focused on. Technology is stilll developing, and while there's a small amount of tech, it's more akin to the egyptians or romans.

## Not Earth At All

### **How does this world differ physically from earth? Is it the same size (same density, same gravity), same ratio of land/water, same atmosphere, etc.? Does it have more than one sun or moon? Rings? Are there spectacular constellations/comets, etc. visible at night or by day?**

The world is larger than earth, further from its star, and thus much colder. The night sky is spectacular on account of there being virtually no light pollution (or pollution in general). The planet is covered in frosty jungles, filled with plants adapted to the freezing temperatures. The caps of the planet are even more extreme than the caps on earth, with temperatures getting to, about -289 degrees celsius.

### **Are there non-human inhabitants of this planet (elves, dwarves, aliens)? If so, how numerous? How openly present? What areas do they occupy?**

Yes. No humans live on this planet. All of these stats have been for the alien race, the [LJKADJSOIJRLKMVLKAFNVLJKGT BRUH]

### **How are the continents laid out? If there is more than one moon/sun, how does this affect winds, tides, and weather generally?**

### **How much land is there, and how much of it is habitable?**

### **Is the axial tilt and orbit the same — i.e., does the world have the same seasons and same length of year as Earth?**

## General world/planet information

### **In which geographical areas will the story take place? How much ground will the story cover? What are the most striking features of landscape, climate, animals, etc. in this area? How will these features affect travel time, communication, etc.?**

### **If there are non-human inhabitants, are there any areas they particularly claim as their own (e.g., dwarves traditionally live underground, usually in mountains)?**

## Climate and geography

### **Have human activities affected climate, landscape, etc. in various regions? How? (Example: Sahara Desert growth has been increased by over-farming.) If this is an alternate earth, will the “alternate” part change existing effects? (If there are no people in N. Africa, desert growth is probably slower.)**

### **How do differences from Earth (multiple suns, moons, etc.) affect the climate in various areas?**

### **How much land is in each of the equatorial, temperate, and polar zones?**

### **Note: climate affects landscape through erosion and weathering; the distribution of plants and animals, and formation of soil. As a result, it determines what crops can and can’t be grown, what animals can and can’t live in an area, what clothes must be worn to cope with the weather, and how houses are built. Winter freezing and thawing may change travel patterns, as waterways freeze or flood and passes close. Weather also affects available sports, like skiing. Are all these things consistent with what you say the climate is like in particular areas?**

### **Where are major mountain ranges? Rivers and lakes? Deserts? Forests, tropical and otherwise? Grasslands and plains?**

### **If there are imaginary animals (dragons, unicorns, etc.), how do they fit into the ecology? What do they eat? How much habitat do they require? Can they live anywhere, or do they prefer or need specific kinds of climate or terrain? Are they intelligent and/or capable of working spells, talking, etc.?**

### **Which resources (e.g., coal, oil, iron ore, gold, diamonds, limestone, etc.) are particularly abundant, and in which areas? Which are scarce? Are there places where there are rich deposits that haven’t been discovered yet, or where they haven’t been fully exploited?**

### **How much conflict has been or might be caused by these imbalances in resources? How much active, peaceful trade?**

### **What water resources available, and for what uses (a mill wheel requires flowing water, i.e., river or stream; irrigation needs a large, dependable water source like a lake or large river; etc.)?**

## World history

### **How far back are there records or tales of historical events? How widely known are these stories?**

### **Do average people believe old tales, or do they dismiss some that have a basis in fact (e.g., Troy)?**

### **How long have there been people on this world? Did they evolve, were they created by the gods, or did they migrate from somewhere else? If there are non-humans, how long have they been around and where did they come from?**

### **How similar is the history and culture of an alternate earth to real history and culture? Why is it similar/different?**

### **Where did civilization begin? What directions did it spread? How was its development affected by the presence of magic? The presence of non-human races, if any? The actions or direct interventions of the gods?**

### **Which peoples/countries/races have traditionally fought, allied, traded, or been rivals? Where are there still hard feelings about old events?**

### **What are the standards of beauty for people? Paintings and sculpture? Clothes and furniture? How do they differ from the standards in your culture (example: a country which considers fatness a highly desirable beauty trait)? How do standard of beauty reflect the physical traits of the various races (examples: dwarves might consider excessive height unattractive; werewolves might be attracted by long teeth or a particular scent)?**

## Architecture
