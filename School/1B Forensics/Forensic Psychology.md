## Process
### Getting Started
1. Forensic psychiatrist determines whether the individual has any neurological or psychological problems that can alter their thinking and undestanding
	- Medical problems (strokes, head trauma, etc.) may impact the assessment
	- Many drugs alter brain function and can affect the assessment
2. Forensic psychiatrist reviews the subject's medical work and military records
3. Police & witness reports are gathered
4. Crime scene photos are gathered
5. Autopsy reports are gathered
6. Blood tests are done
7. Specialised brain testing may be done, e.g.
	- Electroencephalogram (EEG)
	- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	- Computed tomography

### Testing
#### Personality Inventories
- Designed to determine the subject's basic personality type
- Includes:
	- Attitudes
	- Behaviors
	- Thought Processes
	- Beliefs
	- Emotional responses
	- Social abilities
- Highly standardized and reliable
- Common tests include:
	- Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI)
	- Millon clinical multiaxial inventory (MCMI)
	- California psychological inventory (CPI)

#### Projective Testing
- Designed to evaluate the subject's personality and thought processes
- Less standardized and more subjective than [[Forensic Psychology#Personality Inventories|Personality inventories]]
- Used to gain insight into how the subject thinks and how they view themself, others, and the world in general
- Also uncovers any obsessions and fantasies that may drive the subject's actions
- Commonly used tests:
	- Rorschach test
		- The famous inkblot test
	- Projective drawing
		- Subject produces drawings, which are analyzed
		- Person may be asked to draw:
			- A tree
			- A house
			- A member of the opposite sex
			- A fightening experience
		- Drawings can reveal the subject's inner thought process
	- Thematic apperception test
		- Subject is shown pictures of common situations and asked to make up stories to go along with the images
		- Inner thoughts and fantasies may be revealed

#### Intellectual and Cognitive Testing
- Designed to assess the subject's: 
	- Intelligence
	- Mental competency
	- Thought processes
	- Ability to understand their own behavior
- Critical information in determining the subject's level of responsibility and competency to stand trial
- Most common test is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
	- IQ test

### Interviewing
- Forensic psychiatrist interviews subject to probe depper into any areas of concern uncovered by the tests
- Get the subject to relax and speak freely about child, family, and other social interactions
- Determine the subject's attitudes toward past and current events
- Psychiatrist is more interested in motivation than actual events
- Hypnosis is sometimes used to help suspects and witnesses recall certain details
	- Faking hypnosis isn't that difficult, though
- Sodium pentothal (truth serum) is sometimes used
	- Short-acting barbiturate that causes drowsiness and euphoria
	- Any information gained this way is suspect, likely to be challenged in court

## Recognizing Lies
- Malingering is a subject's attempts to make any physical or mental defects appear worse than they actually are or make them up completely
- Psychiatrists look for:
	- Signs of nervousness
		- Sweating
		- Dilated pupils
		- Tremors
		- No eye contact
		- Hesitant or rapid speech
	- Body language
		- Hand-wringing
		- Slumping
		- Slouching
		- Fidgeting
- Neuro-linguistic programming
	- A technique of reading a person's eye movements to determine mental state
	- E.G., looking up and to the side may indicate remembering something
	- Extremely controversial, little scientific backing

---

## Assessing Competence and Sanity
- Court will not accept a confession from someone who is incompetent or mentally ill
- Competency to stand trial means the defendant's ability to understand the charges, the possible consequences of the charges, the working of the courtroom, and the roles of the judge and attorneys
- Common mental disorders that lead to lack of competence:
	- Severe drug or alcohol addiction
	- Organic brain syndromes (stroke, tumor, infection, etc)
	- Severe neurosis
		- Can lead to paranoia or severe anxiety
	- Psychosis and schozophrenia

### Defining Insanity
- Does the suspect suffer from any mental disorder that prevents them from understanding the nature and consequences of their actions?
- You cannot be found guilty by reason of instanity if you didn't know at the time of the crime that your actions were illegal or wrong
- Diminished capacity is a special form of instanity
	- Certain conditions during the crime may reduce the criminals ability to alter their actions or distinguish between right or wrong
	- Claiming this is an attempt to relieve the defendant of criminal guilt or at least reduce the degree to which they're held responsible for the crime/
