## **Basics**

### **World Types**

There are 5 different normal world types in Minecraft: Java Edition, and 1 *hidden* world type, alongside a much more advanced "custom" world type.

> Default

This world type is the normal, natural generation of a minecraft world. It's the standard minecraft experience, generating all biomes and all structures. (See [Biomes](#biomes) and [Structures](#structures))

> Superflat

The default superflat generation has 1 layer of bedrock, 2 layers of dirt, and 1 final layer of grass. No biomes generate, and villages are the only structure that generates.

Superflat worlds do have customization options, though. You can use presets, or create your own. (See [Superflat Presets](#superflat-worlds---presets) and [Custom Superflat Presets](#superflat-worlds---custom-presets))

> Amplified

Amplified worlds generate extreme mountains, with vertical cliffs reaching up to the height limit. Travelling is difficult, and deaths by falling are frequent. This can be very fun if you're looking to challenge yourself, or just looking for an interesting experience! The world will generate all biomes and structures, so it's still possible to beat the game!

> Large Biomes

Large biomes generation is normal world generation, but with every biome 16 times larger. This makes generated structures much more likely to be found, but it can also make finding some rarer or biome-specific resources a huge pain.

> Single Biome

Single-biome worlds will generate using only one biome. Besides that, all (possible) structures will generate.

> Hidden World Type: Debug

The "debug" world type can only be accessed by holding down the ALT key on your keyboard while clicking through the different world types. This world type generates every single block state (See [Blocks in Depth](#blocks-in-depth)) in the game, in a massive grid. The player cannot place or break blocks.

> Custom

Customizable worlds take JSON data (See [What is JSON?](#what-is-json)), which changes how existing dimensions generate, and can also add entirely new dimensions. This is a pretty complicated process, and definitely isn't for any new players. (See [Custom Worlds](#custom-worlds))

### **Superflat Worlds - Presets**

Superflat worlds come with plenty of built-in presets. This video will cover each one, the layers of blocks that make them up as well as the structures that do (or don't) generate.

> Classic Flat

As stated before, the default, classic flat is 1 layer of bedrock, 2 layers of dirt, and 1 layer of grass.

> Tunnelers Dream

The tunnelers dream preset generates 1 layer of bedrock, 230 layers of stone, 5 layers of dirt, and one layer of grass. Strongholds, mineshafts, and dungeons generate, but there are no villages. Ores also generate.

> Water World

The water world preset generates 1 layer of bedrock, 64 layers of deepslate, 5 layers of stone, 5 layers of dirt, 5 layers of gravel, and 90 layers of water. Villages don't generate here either, however, ocean monuments, ocean ruins, and shipwrecks do.

> Overworld

The overworld preset generates 1 layer of bedrock, 59 layers of stone, 3 layers of dirt, and 1 layer of grass. Villages generate, alongside pillager outposts, strongholds, mineshafts, dungeons, and ruined portals.

> Snowy Kingdom

The snowy kingdom preset generates 1 layer of bedrock, 59 layers of stone, 3 layers of dirt, 1 layer of grass, and 1 layer of snow. Only villages and igloos generate here.
