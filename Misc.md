## Math

$$
\text{Sum of Sequence}\\
S_n=\sum_{i=a_1}^{n+(a_1-1)}{(d(i-a_1)+a_1)}\\
$$

$$
\text{Sum of Sequence (Lame)}\\
S_n=\frac{n}{2}(a_1+a_n)
$$

---

$$
\text{Difference of Sequence}\\
d=\frac{a_n-a_1}{n-1}
$$

---

$$
\text{nth Term of Sequence}\\
a_n=a_1+d(n-1)
$$

---

$$
\text{First Term of Sequence}\\
a_1=a_{n_1}-(n_2-n_1)\Big(\frac{a_{n_2}-a_{n_1}}{n_2-n_1}\Big)
$$

---

$$
a_1\ \text{Given}\ S_n\ \text{and}\ a_n\\
a_1=\frac{S_n}{\frac{n}{2}}-a_n
