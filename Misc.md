## Lyrics

no one knows what is after death.
for who is there to speak for the dead?

perhaps it is void;
an empty, gazing abyss;
knowing all; judging harshly.

perhaps a void so empty,
so black and sickeningly vast,
that we cannot even begin to understand it.

perhaps it is heaven,
a utopia, a final resting.

and perhaps it is a wall of misdeeds;
of judgements, of pain inflicted,
of all the sin you have wrought,
of all the wrong you have done.

but perhaps most likely,

it is nothing,

a terrifying, vast, minuscule, imperceptible.

nothing.
