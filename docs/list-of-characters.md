# List of Characters

This document is a list of (almost) all of my characters. It's trimmed down to characters that are at least somewhat thought out, and does not include characters that I do not consider "my character", even if I created them. This just means that characters like NPCs created for a D&D world setting aren't on this list unless they're a character I feel a strong attachment to. **I am aware that D&D characters are technically "original characters", but I'm not sure what else to call the category of "non-D&D characters I've made".**

The way I usually create characters is by finding art to use as inspiration. Images and music inspire me a lot, and so I usually start by finding art I love the aesthetics/vibe of, and then create a playlist of music based on the character. Then, while listening to said playlist, I flesh the character out more. I love doing this, and both art and music really inspire me, not just to make characters. An unfortunate side effect of this, though, is that most of my characters are based on someone elses character or art that I have no rights to. I want to create my own characters and build my own designs, not just take other people's, so each character listing includes whether or not the character has original art, and I want to make an effort to get original art for each character.

Characters are listed in no particular order.
