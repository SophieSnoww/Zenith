# how to die in the middle of nowhere

## simlar to

- night in the woods
- dark
- stranger things??? not really

## what do i even want from this

- hopeless, forgotten vibes
- trying to somehow find happiness when everything appears so bleak
- the small interactions between friends
- identity
- overbearing larger entities (corporation, govts?)
- about capitalism, happiness, change, and the mundane

## what about plot

- someone new moves into town?
- just graduated high school?
- just moved out?
- about to move out?
- definitely post high-school, i dont really want to write high schoolers and i think young adults are just more interesting tbh
- small town without many prospects
