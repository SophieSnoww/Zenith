# Detrimental

claw marks in my lungs!\
i feel my face going numb!\
televise my untimely demise\
for everybody's mom!

noose around my neck!\
i think ive been going deaf!\
cant hear everyone around me\
saying i need to take meds!

---

9 out of 10 doctors agree\
i might be in need of some treatmeant!\
my publicized insanity\
i dont think i need a reason!

i think were all in agreement!\
too much time on the screen and\
i have too many convenient\
excuses not to be decent!

---

kill myself and take my crown\
im drowning in the sound of all the\
bullshit cutting my arteries\
turn your eyes and let me bleed out

disassemble from within\
my inhibitions always win\
i cant believe i tolerate\
everything thats been eating me alive

i cant sleep\
i cant dream\
tear me apart at the seams\
drink to forget\
forget to breathe\
why do you still pity me

medicate\
all this weight\
give you all reasons to hate me\
taste of metal\
broken flesh\
you know im just detrimental
