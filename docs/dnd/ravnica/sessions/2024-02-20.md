# Session 2024-02-20

- We discuss what to do next
- Rivets is deafened
- He wants to stay here, the rest of us are going to Tuesday's sibling's lab
- We give him the address and then erase it before we leave
- After sleeping, we ask Sadie to detect magic/identify it again
  - She says it functions similar to a bag of holding, it has extra space inside to hold extra things
  - It is designed significantly better than a normal bag of holding, though
  - It can contain souls, too
    - It seems like there's at least a couple dozen in there
- We decide to head to an Orzhov library to see if we can find information on necromancy

## Library

- We head into this massive library
- Tuesday flips all the signs just for funsies
- Ophelia just goes up to a librarian and gets him talking about souls
  - Eventually asks him about phylactorys, and he takes us to the section for them
- We find a relatively small book called Common Orzhov Guildmage Practices
  - Tuesday just immediately opens to the perfect chapter
  - This book sucks hard to read, its like reading a ToS
  - To destroy any sort of necromantic object/binding/whatever, you'd want someone who knows how to make them or someone who has divine abilities
- We decide to head to a church
  - Tuesday will steal some religious object to try to break it with
  - Ophelia and I willtalk to a priest and see if we can get them to tell us who the souls are

## Orzhov Church

- Heading in, Tuesday goes invisible and snoops
- Ophelia and I talk to a priest and end up convincing him to help us
- He leads us upstairs to find out who the souls belong to
- The guy fuckin sucks
- We notice a shadow pass across the wall, like someone walked past the door
- I cast truesight on myself
- The priest manages to get the names of the people and realizes Ophelia was lying
- I cast suggestion telling him to give it to us
- When we pick up the box on the floor, it looks like it's made of stone bricks to me, with mist leaking from the cracks
- Going downstairs, I disguise myself as the priest we were talking to to get another priest out of the way
- Tuesday got a bigass divine mace
- We leave, deciding to go to Rivets
