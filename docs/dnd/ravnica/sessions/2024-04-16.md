- I go to Ophelia's grandma's after a rough week
- "Beware the water" from the typewriter
- We go for a picnic
- A strange, multicolored bird comes up to us
  - It's the type of bird thats frequently seen in the selesnia gardens
  - It's a bird of paradise, lazily flying towards us
  - It perches on Ophelia's back
  - There's a small paper note wrapped around its ankle
    - In very perfect, very neat handwriting
    - "with love, luciana"
  - I notice there's something slightly off
    - It makes a weird gagging motion
    - Its long neck looks like a worm
    - It grows about twice as tall
    - Starts making rumbly growling noises
    - Transforms into definitely not a bird
    - It becomes a giant worm
