- We decide to head to the address listed in Volts'(?) journal
- The address is the Rhystic Study
  - The place where the weird works
- We decide to do whatever and kill time until its close to closing
- We go to Ophelia's aunt's house
  - From the house, we're able to see the church where Tuesday used to live
  - Niv Mizzet is doing something down there
- When we leave, Niv Mizzet is gone
  - The church is also missing
  - Tuesday noticed two spectre things on the roofs

## Talking With the Weird

- We talk with the weird
- Volts went mad a day after that picture of them all was taken
- One of their friends went missing and Volts "lost her mind"
  - Immediately switched to thinking Rakdos was a good idea for some reason
  - She doesn't remember who the friend that went missing is
    - "Like there's a hole in my memory"
  - "They were researching some sort of house"
  - Asks me if I brought a set of marked cards, I say yes
    - She tells us we should leave and we hear roaring and destruction sounds from outside

## Running From a Mole

- Out in the street, we can see some variety of creature
  - Looks like a giant mole
  - It's like. taller than a building
- We run
- Ophelia can tell it's not a Selesnya creature
  - It's a minor deity that the Gruul worship
- It's gaining ground on us, but as we turn down different roads we manage to stay ahead of it
- Tuesday explodes a building on top of it and we escape
- We run to Tuesday's sibling's workshop

## The Workshop

- Sunny is working on a monster detector
- Tuesday asks about the shadow creatures we've been seeing
  - Sunny believes they're called spectres
- Sunny asks Tuesdya to get a spool of welding material
  - It's unlocked and very empty except for a single spool
  - The spool has numbers scratched into it
  - I make a note of them
  - They spell out "DELIRIUM"
- There are shits outside
- At night, I look back outside
  - Snow has picked up a bit
  - There are creatures
    - Two sets of eyes, moved maybe a block or two closer
  - There's plenty of puddles, thin fog drifting across the streets
    - Something silvery in the puddles, reflections of something shiny
  - I cast truesight on myself
  - The spectres still exist, but become slightly transparent
  - The reflections on the water go away
  - In the puddle, I see a dim shimmer of something sliding past
    - Like on the other side of the puddle
  - I cast etherealness on myself
  - There are at least a dozen more spectres looking at me
    - 70 feet
    - They are slowly approaching
  - The puddle is still there, in the ethereal plane
    - Three eyes stare back at me through it
    - They're dark, inky black, and when I blink the puddle disappears
    - Nothing I can think of has exactly three eyes
  - The creatures are only 20 feet from me
  - I end etherealness
  - The spectres on Ravnica are at the building across from me
  - The puddle is no longer there
  - I end truesight

## The Next Day

- Sunny is loudly brewing coffee
- Snow is piled up about half a foot
- No spectres that we can see
- We head to the library

## The Library

- On the walk there, we hear plenty of people talking about the mole
- We find a beastiary of sorts, all about amorphous spirits and such
  - We find an entry that resembles what weve been seeing
  - Says that they're most often used for surveillance, to gain or steal information
  - If they incapacitate you, they eat some of your memories
  - If you protect your mind, it won't do much
