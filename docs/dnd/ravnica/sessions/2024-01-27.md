## The Factory

- We walk from the Boros place to the abandoned simic factory(?) that was in Strawberry's file
- The factory is on the other side of a 40ft aqueduct
  - Only bridge is a rusted old walkway
  - Ophelia reinforces it with plants
- There's movement inside
  - A couple dark shadows moving around in the 2nd floor window
- Esper casts pass without trace on everyone
- The factory is 2 floors with a bit of an attic type area on top
  - Roots and plants growing everywhere
  - There's a little door that's overgrown with plants and such
  - We can feel heat radiating from the inside of the building
- We scout around the exterior
  - No windows on the first floor
  - There's some vent or something from the building making bubbles in the water
  - Lots of vines and such
- Ophelia wildshapes into a spider
- We all climb up to the roof, there's a small collapsed area
- Tuesday peeks in and sees two guys, a vedalken and an elf
- Tuesday hears an... unpleasant sound coming from the first floor
  - Like a groaning/grumbling/something
  - She peeks in to see what the guys think and they're scared but not surprised
- Ophelia heads in on the ceiling and gets into a good spot, then Tuesday casts charm person on them
  - The elf gets charmed, the vedalken doesnt
- We hear another loud roaring and a few loud thuds from downstairs
- The vedalken looks very annoyed and Tuesday heads into the room
  - Tuesday tells him she was just doing urban exploration and didnt know there were even people in here
- Another loud bang and the sounds of wood splintering
- The elf says that they're investigating whatever it is downstairs

### The Creature

- There's a heavy wooden door on its last hinges that something is trying to break through
- We all kindof get ready, I head into the building
- The creature breaks through, its a Karasis - a huge weird part-crocodile part-reptile part-frog creature
- Tuesday hits it with a fireball and we can briefly see glowing runes that look carved into its skins or something
- We fuck it up nasty style
  - Fireball -> spike growth -> hunger of hadar -> spike growth again -> dissonant whispers -> grease -> evards black tentacles -> fireball again
- We get the vedalken to put out the fire and just wait, and in a few minutes the monster dies

### Post-Creature

- The vedalken and the elf start arguing, the vedalken is the guys boss
- This was their workspace
- A few weeks ago they were attacked
  - During the night, someone (or something) attacked
  - Everything was burnt, things were stolen, their colleague died
- We talk a bit about the house and the disappearing mansion
- We head downstairs
  - Lots of water, pods of bubbling liquid with creatures in them
  - Very very humid and very dark, no windows
  - Lots of bioluminescence
  - About half of the pods have been ripped out of their sockets
    - Looks more methodical, like they were stolen
- The vedalken points to a specific pod that was shattered
  - It's labeled experiment 37b, thats where the creature came from
- Around the corner, theyre growing algae and stuff
  - Back wall is just covered in gore, the remains of their colleague
  - In the gore is written the name of madame von lust
- Then we head down further to the basement, which is cold storage
- He tells us where his temporary office is at the simic so we can stay in contact
- He gives us the key to a locked room upstairs, saying its where they kept the more dangerous equipment and tools
- It's mostly more cabinets, lots of potions
  - Chemicals and such
  - Other minerals, materials, etc
  - Tuesday finds a potion of blindness
  - Ophelia finds a potion of silence
  - I find a potion that's just labeled "???"
    - It has no cork, its fully sealed so you have to smash it to open it
    - Swirly multi-colored liquid
    - Changes colors based on which way you look at it
- Tuesday finds something, hidden behind one of the pods
  - Black chalk-looking-stuff on the wall, about the size of a normal doorframe
  - Activated doorway, can't rub it off or anything
  - The teleportation crystal does react a little bit to being near the door
  - It doesn't activate or anything but it's a similar type of magic
  - Using far step alongside the teleportation stone I manage to conjure the door and get it to work
    - It's replaced by a long, dark hallway
