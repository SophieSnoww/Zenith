## The Hallway

- It looks like the hallway of a mansion
  - Red carpet, dark wooden trim
- Tuesday steals the simic badge from vladimir as we enter the hallway
- As we step in the portal closes behind us
- Ophelia hears some people talking
  - Sounds like it's on the floor above us
  - Two female voices
  - Sounds like they're putting on makeup and discussing EPIC MAKEUP TIPS AND TRICKS
  - They talk similar to how Tuesday talks
- Ophelia lifts Tuesday up to the ceiling to let her hear
  - They're discussing the show they're preparing for
  - They sound like they have the same voice
- We head down the hallway
  - It's less of a mansion and more like the backstage area of a theater
  - We find a huge costume library
    - We grab some rakdos outfits from the racks to disguise me and Ophelia
- We find a doorway to the space underneath a stage and stairs up to the literal backstage area
- There's currently a show happening onstage
- Tuesday finds a door with a trapped lock
  - The lock has a dart trap in it
  - She disarms it and picks the lock
  - Inside the room is a bunch of Madame Von Lust's personal stuff
  - In the trunk of clothing, at the bottom, there's a small blue leather box
    - It sounds like there's some loose metal inside
    - I can tell it's enchanted
    - It's memory-removing magic
- We decide to try to kill the clones in their dressing room(s)
  - We don't know which room they're in but we go room to room glancing in
  - There's plenty of sounds of the show, carnival sounds
  - We find one of the clones in a dressing room
  - We change our minds
- We decide to kill them on stage, since that's less obvious
  - Tuesday heads up to the rafters to look for things to drop or anything
  - Ophelia and I will go on stage during the act
  - Tuesday puts a bunch of flaming balls into a cage to drop on her

## The Act

- Ophelia and I manage to blend into the crowd alright
- The act starts and we barely hold our own, I manage to protect Ophelia
- Tuesday drops the cage directly onto her mid-act
  - It almost goes right through the stage
  - She is very fucked
- We see her clone in the very back of the crowd
  - She turns and leaves as the curtains close
- We meet up and go after the clone that just left
  - We want to follow her to see where she goes

## The 2nd Clone

- I cast pass without trace
- Ophelia sees her walking off with the big red trunk that we stole stuff from
- We all follow her, managing to stay unseen
- She heads down an alleyway
- Looking into the alleyway, we see her approaching a teleportation node
- I use telekinesis to pull the teleportation stone out of her hand and just hold it in the air
- Ophelia hits her with a beam
- Tuesday gives herself haste and just chills
- I cast lightning bolt down the alleyway
- The clone rummages through stuff, realizes the box we stole isn't there, and then she just disintegrates after saying "you'll pay for this"
- I bring the teleportation stone down and end telekineses
  - On the stone the words "Tea party?"
- Looking at the box again I figure out more about it
  - It's definitely dimir-made
  - It has a few enchantments on it
  - It's a magical container, definitely magically locked
  - There are voices whispering from insides
  - I get the sense that it won't be pleasant for anyone if opened
