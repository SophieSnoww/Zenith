# Session 2024-03-19

- Encoded message on the (blue) door. etc
- Looking in the windows, the house is full of fog

## The House

- We head in, and it's also very cold inside, cold mist flowing over the floor
- We head to the library
  - Almost all the books are about various Izzit inventions and technologies
  - The piano is a mimic
  - The books fall off the shelves by themselves
- We leave quickly and find a study
  - There's a bunch of artificer supplies, parts, tinker's tools
  - Tuesday notices there's something akin to an advanced wiring kit
  - There are a bunch of notes, handwritten in very Izzit handwriting, and red ink
    - The red ink is actually blood
- We leave and find an observatory
  - The door is trapped, tries to cut my hand off
  - Tuesday looks into the telescope and it's stormclouds in the afternoon
  - There's a desk with more notes and writing, specifically about weather patterns here
    - It has a map of the 10th district
    - It doesn't mention anywhere but Ravnica and talks about places very casually
  - There are also some crates of lenses, gears, etc.
    - In one of the boxes there's 100gp
    - In another there's a brass key
- We find a room with no floor, just a huge pit with no visible bottom
  - There's a rickety wooden bridge longways that we can't get to
  - Tuesday uses spider climb to head to the far side of the room where there's a little ledge
    - There's a black coin sitting on the ledge
    - Tuesday picks it up with her mage hand
    - I can't tell much about it magically but I can tell it won't hurt you to touch it
    - I hold onto it
- We turn around and navigate through the house
- I almost fall into an infinite pit beneath the floorboards as we head down a hallway
  - Tuesday saves me with feather fall
- We head further down the hall, find a trapped door
- Past the door is a game room
  - There's a smashed poker table
  - Playing cards strewn around one of the tables
    - The cards are all marked
  - There are a lot of rakdos-type things in the room
  - Tuesday finds poker chips and 56gp
- We head into the next room and we're back in the main room, on the second floor
- We turn back around and find a torn up dining hall
  - We hear a commotion from the room at the far end
  - Tuesday checks, rotten food is flies across the room
  - We discuss a bit. I roll a nat 1 on stealth
  - It goes silent, we all ready action and wait
  - We hear skittering approaching
  - It's a bigass centipede or something ("Skittering Horror")
  - Fight mode
  - We kill it, only after I almost die
- We take a short rest in the kitchen
- Afterwards we try to get into the freezer
  - It's magically frozen shut and takes two keys - one of which is the bronze key we got
- Then we explore the house more and come to a music room with a grand piano
  - It's playing a song called "casualties of war"
  - Looking inside it it's a clockwork piano, wound up and reading a hole-punched sheet of music
  - There's a closet with not much in it
  - There are marks that Madame von Lust was in here
- Then we explore more and find a bathroom
  - The mirror is broken - still fixed to the wall but shattered
    - Each one of your reflections is slightly different
  - We find some of Madame von Lust's lipstick kits around
- Exploring even more, we find a locked, electrified door
  - Tuesday picks the lock and opens it with her mage hand
  - Past it is a bedroom, Madame von Lust's
  - On the desk, theres an envelope with blue wax, open with a letter in it
    - It's from the dimir
    - It's an agreement of sorts
      - If you choose to [] we will supply housing and other resources
- We find a guest bedroom
  - There are 12 portraits hanging around the room, all uneven
    - All the faces have been scribbled over with a black pen
    - Every person in the photos is wearing expensive outfits
    - There are 12 rich people who went missing recently
    - **There is also Strawberry**
      - It's a photo of her scolding the guy from the second session
      - We're all also in the photo
  - There's a connected bathroom
    - The sink and mirror are stained with blood and handprints
- We cross the rickety bridge
- On the other side, we find two more of the coins
- Then it's just secret passage
- Back in the kitchen, we go to the freezer
  - We insert the two keys we have, and there's a lot of machinery happening
  - As Tuesday twists, there's a pressure hiss as the door opens, cold mist running out from under the door
  - Its a huge freezer
  - Suspiciously humanoid-sized meat hanging from the ceiling
  - There's another room that seems almost wedged inside the freezer, walls intercecting each other
