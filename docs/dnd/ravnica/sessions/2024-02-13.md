# Session 2024-02-13

- I can tell the box definitely has some fucky mind-magic involved
- We decide to bring the box to Sadie so she can identify or detect magic it

## The Box

- Sadie immediately recognizes it as. very bad
- She says we probably didn't actually kill the person we took the box from
- It's a phylactory
  - It contains the soul of, someone
  - As long as the box remains intact, the individual is immortal
  - It's probably, almost definitely Madame Von Lust's
- She can't tell exactly what spells are on it
  - There's one abjuration, one enchantment, one evocation
- Tuesday and I remember hearing about a lich
  - Former Golgari guild leader was a lich (until he got petrified)
- I remember hearing a bit about phylactories
  - If the original lich gets destroyed, they reform within ~5ft of their phylactory
    - Assuming they don't have any other "backup" regeneration stuff
- We put the box inside the briefcase/bag of holding that Tuesday has
- We decide to head to Rivets' to see if he has insight, then get counterspell scrolls and try dispel magic

## Rivets

- We head to where his house was
- His house just isn't there anymore
- The houses that used to be on either side of his house are now neighboring houses
- Ophelia notices that there's something etched into one of the bricks
  - It looks like an address
  - It seems to be in a shopping district area towards the center of Ravnica
- We head to the shopping district and find that the address is a tavern called the Rhystic Study
  - Madame Von Lust has been sighted as a regular at this tavern
- Going inside, it's pretty cozy
- Ophelia and Tuesday start talking to a random birdfolk about if he's seen Rivets or Madame Von Lust
- The bartender is a weird, a type of elemental most commonly associated with the Izzet league
  - She's an ice weird with a glowing, fire-like interior
  - I ask if she knows anyone who goes by "Rivets"
  - She says "sorry, I don't really know anyone by that name" but slides me a receipt
  - The receipt has a weird combination of four items on it with a tip of a specific penny value
    - The indentation on each item is slightly off
    - Locations of the letters and choice of numbers feels deliberate
    - One of the four items isn't an actual menu item
      - It just says "party time martini"
    - I've seen something like this before
      - I've had to work with hidden codes as well
      - I remember doing some stuff like having a piece of paper that blocks specific words in the paragraph of a book to make a new sentence
      - Rivets' business card has holes punched in it
      - I hold it over the receipt
        - It says "tea party?" with an address
- Ophelia went in to the back room
  - Found pictures of a younger Madame Von Lust alongside the bartender
- Tuesday goes to the bartender and asks if Madame has been here
  - The bartender immediately looks
  - She says that Madame *used* to frequent here, but hasn't visited in a long time

## Tea Party

- We decide to get spell scrolls before heading to the address
  - Ophelia buys a few blank spell scrolls
  - Tuesday wants to try to steal a 6th level counterspell
    - She casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter on one of the guards
    - While everyone's attention is on the guard, she uses mage hand to grab the scroll
    - She manages to go unnoticed
    - She steals a keychain off of the guard's belt as she leaves the shop
- We head to the address we got from the receipt
  - The door is down a small alleyway
  - It's basically right across the street from the Rhystic Study
  - It looks just like an apartment, a bit bigger than a normal apartment building, sortof like offices
  - We can all hear a bit of movement inside
- Ophelia knocks on the door, all the movement quiets down
- The door opens just a bit and Rivets is looking back at us
- Lets us in after a short conversation
  - It's a pretty nice apartment, old furniture
  - Something like a 4 bedroom apartment
  - Big bulletin board with a ton of paper pinned onto it
  - There's a briefcase that has a stonework and cabling pattern on it
    - His house is inside the briefcase
  - He didn't leave the clues, he was following them
  - Also was led here for a "tea party"
  - Looks very spooked when we mention Madame Von Lust
  - He looks at the phylactory and says yes, its obviously trapped
    - Shuffles through a drawer to get a ring, puts it on, and casts some dissipation spell on the phylactory
    - Air around it starts to warp, it crackles and the voices emits whispers and glows
    - The whispers turn into screams as he dispels more of the magic on the box
    - He was seemingly able to dispel at least one of the wards affecting it, box pops open while hes speaking
- Dark clouds swirl around the room from the box, filling the room with black smoke before the box closes again
  - Tizo fight!
- The box is disarmed now, though it's still a functional phylactory
  - Inside the box is a dark, misty interior that you can't see the bottom of
  - Tuesday drops a ball bearing in
    - It just disappears into the fog and doesn't hit any bottom
