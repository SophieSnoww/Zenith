# Session 2024-04-08

- The huge room is very cold, and has lots of water
- Can't see the bottom of the room/well
- Soft cackling/laughing
- The center of the room is a fountain of frigid water
  - Crackling with electricity and magic
- Light at the middle of the fountain is a single flower
  - Cables attached to the mount(?) it's in
- Around the whole fountain is a shield, a dome of force

## VON LUST BOSS FIGHT

- Lots of taunting from her
- Comments about Tuesday's dead sibling
- Comments about my father and running away from problems
- Just kindof mean to Ophelia

## It Happens

- We kill her
- Ophelia finds a journal, neatly kept but clearly very old
  - Pressed flowers, every single page completely full of tiny blue handwriting
- Tuesday talks about her sibling to Ophelia
  - Their parents weren't good, so their oldest sister Monday took them to the Selesnia
  - Didn't fit in
  - Over time, the siblings all left
  - Tuesday and Wednesday both joined the Rakdos
  - Wednesday died
- I take off both of my rings and toss them into the water of the room
- We leave, walk through the house, it's completely empty. Dead.
- There are Azorius guards outside and a big crowd
  - Niv Mizzet on the roof opposite the building
- We just walk straight out
- I go to a tavern to get a room and cast sleep on myself
- Ophelia goes to her aunts to wash off the blood
- Tuesday collapses into her siblings' arms and they take her to their lab
