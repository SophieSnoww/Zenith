- We decide to just go for it, into the undercity
- Pretty confident there aren't any specters nearby
- Ophelia gets a familiar feeling
  - Like when you're casting speak with plants
  - "Lifeforce slithering underneath you"
  - Get the sense that there are roots growing underneath us
- Some sort of tree sprouts between the bricks right in front of us
- We're in more of a commercial area, a couple people around
- Tuesday readies firebolt
- Ophelia casts speak with plants
  - It's like the tree is whispering with a dozen or more voices at the same time
  - Can't really make out what it's trying to say at first
  - It speaks in "what I can only describe as metallic voices"
    - It sounds like metal scraping past as it speaks
  - "What's it you want"
  - Ophelia asks why it's growing here
  - "Must summon"
    - It's branches spread out into a circular shape with an opening in the middle
  - Ophelia asks who's summoning them
  - "Not me, I must summon"
  - Asks who they're summoning
  - "Not who, what"
    - A small glowing orb appears in the center of the circle of branches
  - "It is my instruction"
  - Ophelia asks from who
  - "They care for me, I do what they say"
  - "I am allowed to flourish"
  - "I am trying to summon resources"
    - The pinpoint of light gets brighter and brighter, then explodes out
    - The tree is destroyed
    - It explodes into almost an entirely new structure
    - Looks very similar to when the house expanded inside the church
    - This time it looks like a water tower
      - Big glass dome at the top, 4 pillars lodged in the earth
      - Full of a swirling blue liquid
    - There is an antimagic field surrounding the tower

## The Tower

- We climb the tower
- About halfway up is a platform that goes around all 4 legs
- The tubes have drained of the liquid, but the bulb at the top still has plenty
  - I can tell the liquid is pure arcane energy, distilled magic
- There's a control room-esque thing on the platform that we head into
  - Sending stone inside
  - A warning system goes off as soon as the legs are drained
    - There are wires from the alarm to other stuff
    - Some wires go to a lockbox, and it seems like a specific drawer unlocked when the alarm started going off
    - Another box outside also unlocked
  - Tuesday can tell the telescope is worth a lot
  - Ophelia finds a small book talking about what the liquid is
    - The liquid is called "aether"
  - Ophelia and I head outside to investigate
  - Door locks behind us
    - Appears like the lock is on the outside
- The box outside is a toolbox
  - 3 sending stones
  - 1 screwdriver
  - 1 wire cutter
- Box next to each pipe
  - It's a pump, screeching as there's no fluid to pump
  - find pump e
    - if pressure in the gague is in the red, itll explode
    - the thermometer should be near the pressure gauge
  - It has a maintenance panel, and inside:
    - BOTTOM RIGHT **(PUMP W)**
      - 0-9 number panel, 7 segment display, light blinking in morse code
        - `... - .-. --- -... .`
      - 5 keyholes, 1 **golden** key
        - Golden, silver, lead, iron, and copper keyholes
      - 6 wires all crisscrossed
    - BOTTOM LEFT **(PUMP N)**
      - 0-9 number panel, 7 segment display, light blinking in morse code
        - `...- . -.-. - --- .-.`
        - 3595
      - 5 keyholes, 1 **iron** key, **orange light**
        - Golden, silver, lead, iron, and copper keyholes
      - 5 wires
    - TOP LEFT **(PUMP E)**
      - 0-9 number panel, 7 segment display, light blinking in morse code
        - `-... --- -..- . ...`
      - 5 keyholes, 1 **golden** key, **orange light**
        - Golden, silver, lead, iron, and copper keyholes
      - 3 wires
      - **IF PUMP E OR N EVER READS HIGHER THAN 346 THEN REVERSE FLOW DIR**
      - Pressure gauge - 1.9 atmospheres
      - Thermometer L (temp of air) - 268K
      - Thermometer R (temp of aether) - 272K
    - TOP RIGHT **(PUMP S)**
      - Not actually on the platform
      - 0-9 number panel, 7 segment display, light blinking in morse code
        - `-... --- -- -... ...`
        - 3565
      - 5 keyholes, 1 **silver** key
      - 6 wires
- Type 3595 into pump N and it powers off
- Type 3565 into pump S and it powers off
- Head to pump E
  - I put the key in the lead lock and turn it
  - It reverses the direction of the pump
    - It starts pulling aether from the chamber above down and out of the pipe
- Some cracks are forming from the pumps to the bulb
- The bulb explodes but time stops - the snow stops and the pieces stop
- Slowly, time moves backward, the orb un-shattering, we walk backwards for a second
- We did the wrong sequence
- We turn the N and S pumps off at the same time

## Aftermath

- Aether is drained into the bricks below
- Niv Mizzet arrives and we have a fun chat
