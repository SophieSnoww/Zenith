# Session 2024-04-02

- The room were in is intersected by what looks like the corner of another room
  - The walls aren't damaged at all, though
  - It almost looks like the bricks were cut into the weird angles
- Opening the door into the intersecting room, there's a pentagram and strange symbols on the floor
  - Tuesday can tell the pentagram it's more communication based
    - Closer to scrying than summoning
    - It's not really tied to Rakdos (the demon specifically), though
  - I look around and find that it looks like bricks repeat
    - Like there are duplicate bricks a couple times
- Down a wonky hallway, we enter a ????????
  - The door slides shut and locks behind us
  - There's a pipe sticking out of a wall, and is dripping water
    - It very quickly starts filling the room with water

## Escape Room 1

- 1 5 letter combo
- 1 4 number combo
- 9 normal locks
- Tuesday picks the first lock
- Ophelia looks inside the incinerator
  - There's a serial number scratched into the iron
  - Only legible number is a 4
- I scan for anything close to the floor
  - There's a little cardstock type piece of paper
    - It's an invoice of some sort for some workshop materials
    - It's in very crude abyssal
    - I give it to Tuesday to ead
      - It's an invoice for 7 iron spires(?)
        - The spikes you put on a roof
      - Signature from someone we don't know
- Tuesday picks the second lock
- Ophelia looks at the work desk made of stone
  - Looking at anything inside/under it before it gets submerged
  - Accidentally pulls a shelf completely out, off of its rail
  - On the backside of the shelf, there's more writing
    - "rakDos ironworking"
- I look through a pile of rat bones (and other rat parts)
  - Sitting next to a small trash bin
  - In the trash bin is a crumpled sticky note
    - "can somebody please deal with these RATS"
    - "RATS" is triple underlined
- Tuesday fails to pick the third lock
  - It seems like each time they pick a lock, the other locks get harder
  - And every time they mess up, the water rises faster
- Ophelia finds a plaque above the door we walked in through
  - "ROOM II" or "ROOM 11", unsure
- I investigate a set of broken drawers
  - I find a few books, they look like engineering textbooks, boring stuff
  - One book is a short story/novella
    - Titled "The Ascending of Boros Angels"
    - No author listed
    - It's completely blank
- Tuesday picks the third lock
- Ophelia looks at the stone shelf
  - It has decorations on it like you'd find in someones office area
  - There's a framed photograph, glass unbroken
    - The metal frame is slightly rusted
    - It's a photo of a couple imps doing some ironworking
    - On the back of the frame, it's dated
      - "Saturday, Selesni 9"
      - The year is faded and illegible
- I check out the pipe that's filling the room with water
  - It's old, rusted, bit of moss
  - I find a stamp, painted onto the underside of the pipe
  - It's a red oval logo that says "Izzet Waterworks Company"
- Tuesday picks the fourth lock
  - It's hard (25 barely succeeded)
- Ophelia notices a brick in the ceiling
- I head over and use a crossbow bolt to get it loose
  - It falls to the floor alongside a little key
  - It's a small steel blue key
    - It matches a lock on the door that's the same color
- There are 4 locks remaining
  - One is the steel blue
  - One is painted red, same logo as the pipe
  - One is brass, rotated upside down weirdly
  - One is a golden security lock
- Water is at our waists
- I give Tuesday the key
- Tuesday unlocks the steel blue lock and picks the fifth lock
- Only 2 locks remaining
  - Gold, ominous security lock
  - Red one
- Ophelia tries `4793` on the number lock
- I check the pipe for any keys, don't find anything
- Tuesday tries to jiggle the numbers lock to see if anything is correct
  - The lock isn't even loose
- There are a couple objects floating in the water
  - One of them is a soggy wad of paper
    - It's another sticky note complaining about rats
    - "i told you to deal with them whem the *first* one showed up"
    - Also writing on the other side
    - "you didn't even send a letter until 2 days later"
- (METAGAME) It's not adding 2 to the date to get 11
- There's pipes on the ceiling, dripping water slightly
- I notice the pipe
  - Written on the underside, there's a W (?)
  - Hard to tell just because of positioning
- We have all the clues
- Tuesday jiggles the number lock without submitting it to see whats first
  - 2 is first
- Letter combo is "DIMIR"
- Number combo is 2479
- Tuesday picks the red lock
- Tuesday picks the gold lock using mage hand

## Post Escape Room 1

- Water starts to evaporate as soon as the door is unlocked
- We head down a hallway and find a room with a piano, smashed research vials
- Piano is playing itself, sheet music on it that's been edited with notes
  - Extra spools of the auto-piano rolls set to the side
- Ophelia finds 2 greater healing potions, a potion of flight, a splash potion of feather falling, and a potion of fire giant strength
- Lots of books on alchemy
- I find some spell scrolls, most are written in a language none of us know
- One in particular is wish
- Tuesday finds a hidden shelf doorway (probably)
- We pull books and open it

## The Void

- We find a room that looks like astronomy stuff, has a telescope
- Part of the room is destroyed, floating out into a vast endless blackness
- There's a note floating a little ways out in the void
- Tuesday uses mage hand to grab the paper
  - The paper is written on a typewriter
  - It's talking about the house we're currently in
  - And where things go when they don't exist on a plane
  - "I fear that tampering with things like this can cause the barrier between existence and nonexistence to weaken"
- The room is slowly disintegrating into the void
  - There's a typewriter with blue and black ink (as opposed to a normal red/black)
  - The letters I've gotten were written in blue
- There's a set of drawers that's completely empty
  - Seems like everything except the typewriter was removed
- Tuesday tries to write "Tuesday was here"
  - It instead types "You might want to take this..."
  - I keep typing and it says "A gift."
  - Then it types as normal
- Tuesday remembers the box, it's welded shut
- Then we head back to the other room

## Back

- The door has no handle, knob, lock, anything
  - It has metal grating, small enough you can't see through
- The door doesn't open when we say "open", nor "open" in abyssal
- Tuesday switches through songs
- When playing "casualties of war", the door unlocks
- We head into the passage...

## The Room

- Insanely large room, massive pillars
- Murky water at the bottom, parts of it freezing
- Slowly ascending, floating rocks up to the center platform
- In the middle of the platform is a big fountain
  - It's crackling with electricity, shooting off the occasional lightning bolt
  - There's a blue rose/lotus in the middle of the fountain, wired in to the contraption
  - There's a force field/energy shield surrounding the flower
- Lots of chains and pipes throughout the entire room
- The entire room and all the platforms make up the Dimir logo
