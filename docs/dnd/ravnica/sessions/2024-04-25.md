- After killing the bird that transformed into a worm
- We decide to go into the Selesnya
- We slink around a bit and find an entrance with only a few guards
- Luckily we get in, only Ophelia has to show ID
- We wander around and find Luciana
  - She said it was just a gift
  - She's not lying, but
  - She shows signs of having memories removed
- I tell Ophelia
- She gives Luciana her ring of mind shielding
- Sitting in an alleyway and talking about it, I see a ring in a puddle, but it disappears
- As we're leaving, Ophelia sees a shadow slip behind the roof of a building
- We don't see anything as we go to Ophelia's Aunt's house
- We try to find Rivets

## Trying to find Rivets

- We head to the last place we saw Rivets
- On the way, we spot a creature, with eyes peering at us from the top of one of the spires, hanging on like a wyvern perched on a lightning rod
  - None of us can tell what it is
  - It almost immediately vanishes into a puff of smoke
- From the outside, the building is suppoed to be a town home style apartment complex
  - The building is a bit too small for his workshop
- We talk with him
- He agrees to make 4 rings
- He also agrees to open the welded shut box we found
  - Inside is a handful of trinkets
    - A little flying machine (ornithopter)
    - A rudimentary lightbulb, it's lopsided and uneven, looks very homemade
    - A set of tinkerer's tools, very old but well made
      - Wooden, very finely kept
      - All the oils and greases to maintain them
    - A small brass locket, circular
      - Embossed on the front is a very ornate izzit logo
      - On the back, there's a handful of symbols
      - Inside is two tiny photos
        - One is an izzit scientist with raven black hair, starry eyes, human
        - The other is a weird
    - Some random change
