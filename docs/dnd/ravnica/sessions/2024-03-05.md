# Session 2024-03-05

- We actually decide to head to Tuesday's abandoned church
- We sleep for the night and then think about where to destroy the phylactery
- All of us look for a basement in the church
- We find one, its musty as hell but it works

## The Basement

- As we look around, we notice something slithering in the shadows of the room
- Tuesday throws a ball bearing
  - It bounces a few times and then sticks to the wall
  - After a moment it gets absorbed into the wall
- Tuesday finds a torch and lights them using produce flame
- There's thick dust in the air, a layer of dust on everything
- Tuesday and I see that everything is very dry and dusty, except the back wall
  - The back wall where the ball bearing got absorbed looks damp
- We kill an ooze as well as two spiders
- I see a message that says "You probably want to go outside for a smoke break"
- The box also starts smoking a bit more at the same time
- We head upstairs to smash the box

## Breaking the Box

- Ophelia smashes the box with the divine mace
- As it breaks, all of us see that the box appears to be made of stone on the inside
  - Then the smoke, shards, and stone all erupt out of the box
  - It's more stone than could fit in the box
- Something that was inside erupts outwards
  - It's the big house that disappeared a while back
- We all run out of the church
- We move Tuesday's stuff to Ophelia's aunt's house
- Then we take a short rest
