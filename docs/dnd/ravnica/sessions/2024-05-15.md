- We head to visit Niv Mizzet
- It's snowing pretty hard, sky is dark grey, etc.
- On the way, we run into four spectres
- Once we kick their ass, the sun is just about starting to rise
- We finish heading to Niv Mizzet

## Talking with Niv Mizzet

- No magic can be cast here
- We're offered dry clothes but only Ophelia takes them
- We talk with Niv Mizzet and he tells us he wants us to get the seed back
- The dry clothes Ophelia took are magical, used for cloaking
- Gives us a map of the undercity with locations marked
  - They're the locations suspected to be access points for the Dimir

## Going to Rizzet's

- The Rhystic Study is no longer there
  - It's been replaced by a completely unrelated bookstore
  - It's called Fact or Fiction
- We head into Rizzet's, he finished the last two rings
