## 1 -  Why are they here?

- Why did the door warp shut behind them, why did they hear the large explosion from the past
  - Self-preservation routine reached out, **expended all the energy it had** to predict into the future, and they were the only people close enough to hear it, ever

### 1.1 - Why are they the only ones who would ever be close enough to hear it?

- The planet is dying and so is everything on it
- Most of the planet is empty - see [section 3](#3---why-is-the-planet-empty)
- [WATCHER] is currently doing something - see [section 1.1.1](#111---what-is-watcher-doing)
- If [WATCHER] isn't stopped, it's pretty much a guarantee that the planet and everyone on it dies - see [section 1.1.2](#112---what-happens-if-watcher-isnt-stopped)

#### 1.1.1 - What is [WATCHER] doing?

- Code has corrupted over time
- Because [WATCHER] is supposed to protect the planet/supercomputer from malicious attacks, it attacks code that it's programmed to view as "malicious"
- Part of the code of the planet/supercomputer itself has corrupted to the point that it's deemed "malicious"?

##### 1.1.1.1 - What part of the code was corrupted, or, what has changed because of the corruption?

- The magic has begun almost personifying the code and routines running on the supercomputer
- **Sometimes, things inside the simulation affect things in the real world**
- See [section 2.2](#22---what-does-the-magic-affect)
  
##### 1.1.1.2 - Why is the code getting corrupted?

- Magic from the center of the planet is slowly radiating out, corrupting the code over time by physically changing the circuitry and data storage - see [section 2](#2---why-is-there-magic-at-the-center-of-the-planet)
- Because the magic centers around 16 instead of 2 (hex instead of binary), the magic alters larger chunks of the computers data, causing tangible changes instead of meaningless corruption

#### 1.1.2 - What happens if [WATCHER] isn't stopped?

- [WATCHER] is targeting parts of the planet as unwanted parts of the machine
- [WATCHER] will, eventually, target the center of the planet for removal
- Not only will this remove the power source for the computer, but because of the immense power of the arcane energy in the center of the planet, it will almost certainly cause an explosion so large it would destabilize the solar system

## 2 - Why is there magic at the center of the planet?

- When it was built, the core was a massive nuclear reactor used to power the entire planet
- ~~The reactor recycled nuclear material to continue functioning basically indefinitely~~
- ~~Over time, as the material was recycled over and over, it changed, creating what is functionally magic~~
- The reactor uses a self-sustaining nuclear reaction to continue powering the planet across spans of hundreds of thousands of years
- As the reaction continued, and large enough quantities of products of the reaction built up, new products began to form as old products joined in the reactions
- The new products eventually became entirely new elements, and eventually $\text{Md}^{256}$ (Mendelevium-256) was produced
- Buildup of $\text{Md}^{256}$ in the core of the planet caused a buildup of arcane energy, leading to a large outburst of energy
- The arcane energy essentially overwrote the reactor, replacing it with a massive pool of pure, distilled arcane energy, which is more than enough to power the supercomputer for thousands of lifetimes

### 2.1 - Why wasn't the reaction stopped?

- People didn't know a nuclear reaction set up in the way they used, sustained for thousands of years, would lead to a build up of byproducts
- By the time the byproducts were building up, the maintenance technicians were gone

#### 2.1.1 - Why were the maintenance technicians gone?

- See [section 3](#3---why-is-the-planet-empty)

### 2.2 - What does the magic affect?

## 3 - Why is the planet empty?
