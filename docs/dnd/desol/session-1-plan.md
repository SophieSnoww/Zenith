# Desol Session 1 Plan

- They hear a large sound that sounds slightly distorted, almost
- Following the sound, they go a little ways into the planet - not to deep but not a small depth either
- They find a lab nestled into the planet

## The Lab

- It looks overgrown - not anything like an explosion just happened
- However it also looks.. distorted, in a weird way
- Walk in, door disappears behind them
- There's two rooms - a main workspace and a living quarters, connected by a door
- There's also a closet, but there's not much in it

### The Workspace

- The workspace is messy - papers strewn everywhere, computers and cables all over the place
- It looks abandoned
  - All of the papers are disintegrating
  - Computers are dusty
  - Plants are growing through cracks in the walls
- On the far wall is a large machine
  - It's a cylindrical metal thing, suspended from the ceiling by sulfur aggregate concrete rods
  - Below the machine is a massive pit, far too deep to see the bottom of
  - There are many cables running from the machine to various things - disappearing into the pit, plugged into computers in the workspace
    - The thickest cables run down into the pit, secured to the walls
- In front of the pit is a set of computers and a table with a mouse and keyboard
- On the left is the doorway to [the living quarters](#the-living-quarters), as well as a doorway to the closet
- On the right is a large desk, as well as a metal observation deck type area

### The Living Quarters
