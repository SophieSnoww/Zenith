# 001

- brought to a room relatively deep in the planet with a huge machine inside
  - its clearly a research lab of some type
  - looks like it was left in a hurry
  - has lots of tech in it they dont recognize or understand
    - from what they understand, its blending the lines of tech and magic
    - motherboard with magic runes inscribed onto them, etc
    - they can physically feel the magic in the room
- get them to focus on trying to turn the machine on
  - use each persons skills
    - acer - competetive chess robot
      - knows programming
    - sabrina - gremlin tech possum girl
      - good at messing with hardware
    - maddi - emotions + singing robot
      - make the machine feel emotion?
        - would make for great lore exposition
- found the machine because someone else activated it?
  - start seeing these trails of magic/tech, visible subroutines
  - eventually on their way down, they feel/hear a large sound, vibrations shaking everything around them, and the visible trails disappear

## vague ideas

- keys on a keypad or keyboard worn off from repeated presses
- one of the robots has to go into a computer (simulation or whatever)
  - the computer then asks whoever's on the outside to place enemies
  - or, ask them all to design something, then make them deal with it?

## what is the machine

- the machine was made by researchers attempting to breach the barrier between magic and technology
- the machine is just designed to take in and store magic inside it, gathering magic from the surrounding area

## why is it off

- uses an immense amount of power, unsustainable long run
- the researchers are long gone, the project abandoned because of magical creatures appearing and chasing researchers off
  - the magical world has a large amount of creatures inside it, attuned specifically for it
  - attuning to the magical world or interactive with it means those creatures can access our reality

## notes

- one researchers space
  - he was sortof like a mad scientist type
  - researching technology and its integration with magic
  - manufactured a machine that pulls magical energy from the space around it
    - deeper in the planet is more arcane, so its over/in a huge hole
      - at the bottom of the hole is an array of lanthanum hekaidecahydride superconductors laid out in single-atom-thin sheets
    - the visible part of the machine is basically a massive capacitor
- machine is called "hekaideitor"
  - combination of transmitter and arcana?
  - arcaduct

## the puzzle

- need to get into a computer
  - turn it on?
  - password
  - passkey
- multiple stations/clues/whatever around the room
  - main computer
    - "insert passkey" then "enter password"
    - password hint?
    - straight up just a sticky note of the password?
      - password is "hekaidecaDemon(character for 8)"
      - password is "9310131612"
  - desk on the right side of the room
    - papers covering it with notes about magic, superconductors
    - in a drawer, two in-tact papers
      - color-highlighted numbers for the safe
      - key for the hexadecimal script
  - walkway/observation platform on right side of the room
  - a doorway on the right leading to more of a living space
    - combination lock on a safe
      - sticky note that says "r g b (16 in hex system)"
      - inside is a small thing that looks like a usb stick (the passkey)

## after

- the huge machine releases a blast of energy and suddenly all of them can almost interface with tech/magic innately
  - give each person slightly varying abilities, based on their personality?
    - dev - interfaces closely with hardware
      - visible flow of electricity
      - circuitry and heat can be visualized
    - n3m - very logical and competetive
      - easily think through events
      - can extrapolate backwards from an outcome
    - aoede - emotional and artistic
      - in tune with the feelings of everything
      - can functionally talk with technology as well as understand how magical creatures are feeling
  - all can sense sources and users of energy and magic
- lights turn on around them, computers and monitors flicker on when they get close

## maybe

- transported to a location none of them have seen
  - physically, they can feel theyre deep in the planet
  - maintenance hallways, metal walkways over huge, pitch-black pits
  - lights turn on around them, computers activate around them
  - rooms full of forgotten equipment, not plugged in, that still flickers on when they get close enough
  - no dust
  - theres everything - living quarters, research labs, offices
    - seems like a whole city with nobody in it
  - entire place feels arcane, like its alive with energy
