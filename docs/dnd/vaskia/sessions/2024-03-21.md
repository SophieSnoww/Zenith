## Intros

### Kallisto

- Wakes up after camping on a mountain near Brenbere
- Going about her normal daily routine
- Makes some food (rabbit pies/calzones/whatever)
- Heads down from the mountains towards the town
- Finds a poster for the brothers of stone offering work
  - Explore a mine looking for an artifact for 200gp

### Me

- I wake up in someones house
  - It's a pretty nice house
  - Large queen sized bed, nicer quality sheets
  - Room in disarray
    - Not sure if it was last night but it was definitely recent
    - Mahogany dresser with drawers pulled out
  - Dark pants, dress shoes ish
  - I just grab a shirt I *think* was mine
  - I head out into the rest of the house
  - I definitely get the impression that this person is relatively off
  - I find a couple photos of a family
    - 3 individuals
      - A very tall, burly, half-orc, thick sideburns, attractive
      - In his arm is a drow woman who looks stern, bright white hair
      - Between them is a child that looks about 12, 13, a dark-skinned orc
  - There's other photos
  - I head to the kitchen and make some raw eggs
  - I find like 7-10 pre-made snack pouches
  - I just take an apple
- I head out and just immediately walk into a fence
- I kindof wander and just eventually find the poster for the cave job

### Actaeon

- Has a cabin up in the mountains
- Just looks like Gandalf basically

## The Job

- We all end up at the windmill
- We can hear someone inside
- They tell us to come in
  - It's very messy inside, it's clear they're repairing the windmill
  - It's a tiefling inside, named Crato
  - They want us to find an artifact in the cavern
    - They believe it to be some sort of magical cube
  - He gives us directions to the mine
  - We grill him a bit about stuff
  - He's kinda shifty

### The Mine

- We head through the forest, some nice convo
- The mine is just a large built outcropping into the face of a cliff
- Actaeon apparently has darkvision
- I cast dancing lights for Kallisto
- Only Actaeon notices:
  - They know the brotherhood is interested in finding pieces of technology from the lost kingdom and taking them apart to re-utilize for new inventions
  - Magical artifacts have a specific vibe around them, and Actaeon definitely can tell we're getting close to magical potential
- Once we can't see any daylight, we start to notice that the rocks have a faint glow
  - Actaeon and I can tell there's another mineral here that's not the normal stone
    - It's in crystals sticking out of the walls
    - They're blinking, like it's being turned on and off
    - When one goes out, another turns on
  - Kallisto notices that there's a larger boulder
    - And also sees legs stick out from under it as it starts skittering

#### The Fight

- I drop my dancing lights and Kallisto turns on their lantern
- We fight glowing rock crab thingies
