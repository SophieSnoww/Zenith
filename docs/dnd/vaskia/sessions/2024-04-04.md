## The Mine Contd

- We short rest after the fight, and Kallisto cooks the rock crabs for us
- As we eat, an 8 foot goliath tries (and fails very hard) to sneak up on us
- Lovely, awkward interaction
- Heading deeper, we see more specks of the same sort of electric gemstone
- It eventually opens up into a wider room, pretty darn large
  - It's pretty circular, very very dark
  - Half collapsed passageway to the left, piles of mining junk
  - Rummage through the crates
  - Find a lot of the glowing stone, but it's out of power(?)
  - Actaeon finds. pain
