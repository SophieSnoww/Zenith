## Overview

This document is basically my own "awesome-x" list. Having all the software and websites I use in one place is nice. Just because something is on here, doesn't mean I recommend it. It just means it's what I use.

## Software

### Navidrome

[Navidrome Website](https://www.navidrome.org/)

Navidrome is the server I run to host my music files. Instead of paying for Spotify premium or whatever, if you're willing to put in some work, set up a Navidrome server and listen to all the music you want for free.

### yt-dlp

[yt-dlp Website](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

Incredibly good command-line tool for downloading video and audio off of not just YouTube, but also most other sites. HIGHLY recommend.

### Zerotier One

[Zerotier Website](https://zerotier.com/)

I cannot recommend Zerotier enough. Completely free and allows you to set up VPNs between devices incredibly easily. Makes throwing up servers for friends incredibly easy, and means you can easily connect to all your other devices without any hassle. In combination with remote desktop protocol, it means you can remotely access your desktop from anywhere.

### Firefox

[Firefox Website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

The best browser in my opinion. If you're a privacy fanatic, Librewolf is better, but for most people, Firefox is all you need. For me, just the fact that it's not built on chromium means I like it, but it has lots of extension support and works just as well as any other browser.

### QbitTorrent

[QbitTorrent Website](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)

Haven't found any other filesharing/torrenting software I like as much as QbitTorrent. I don't have much to say about it other than that you should use it.

### Davinci Resolve

[Davinci Resolve Website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

Really good video editing software. Premiere Pro and After Effects are still industry standard as far as I'm aware, but Davinci can do everything they can. It's a different workflow - especially for VFX - but if you get used to it it works just as well. I used PP+AE for something like 6 years before switching to Davinci, and it took some convincing and a bit of a transition period, but at this point, I prefer it over Adobe's video editing products.

### VSCode

[Visual Studio Code Community Edition Website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

VSCode is just my favorite editor, whether its markdown, javascript, rust, or just plaintext. The extensions market is incredible, and functionality like snippets and custom styles (using themes or plugins like [Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight)) make it very customizable.

### OBS Studio

[OBS Project Website](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS is good. The plugins available mean you can do basically whatever you want. It can be slightly more difficult to learn than things like Streamlabs OBS, but OBS Studio is infinitely more customizable. The only thing SLOBS has over default OBS is selective recording, letting you set specific elements to only be streamed or recorded, but even then you can emulate that functionality in OBS using a plugin called [Source Record](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-record.1285/), though it's a bit scuffed.

#### OBS Plugins I Like

- [OBS Shaderfilter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-shaderfilter.1736/)
- [Spectralizer](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/spectralizer.861/)
- [Tuna](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/tuna.843/)
- [Move](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move.913/)
- [Motion Filter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/motion-effect.668/)
- [Waveform](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/waveform.1423/)
- [Transition Table](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/transition-table.1174/)

## Websites

### Vultr

[Vultr Website](https://www.vultr.com/)

I'm not sure how I feel about Vultr. I want to set up my own server so I'm not paying some third party company each month just to run servers. Vultr gets it done, though, and from what I found it's a pretty good option. Their website works well and they are what they say on the tin.

### Godaddy

[I'm not linking Godaddy's website because they don't deserve it so here's a great song instead](https://soundcloud.com/pinkmouse/kalifornia)

I do not like Godaddy, however, I do use it to host my websites. I need to move off of it and have been looking into doing so recently, but for now it's what I use.
