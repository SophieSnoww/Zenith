## Backstory

Sarah Hayes, also known as Rose Keres and Harley Wulf, is a late-twenties vulpin rogue that currently works as a field agent, bodyguard, and assassin. She's known for holding grudges, and for having a very long patience, planning things and showing nothing is amiss for long periods of time before acting, which usually means killing someone or getting revenge in some way. In the business world, she's known for being a very efficient, precise, and effective assassin and bodyguard. Most of the people she works for know that she should basically be left alone and not bothered, as almost anyone who has been vulnerable or attempted to get close to her has had their attempts used as blackmail or a subject of humiliation. She enjoys toying with people, luring people in with sex or taunting them (or both) before slitting their throat. She enjoys a drug called lumina, which provides intense euphoria and usually puts her in a manic state. Because of the fact that she works for large organizations, and most of the higher ups in said organizations know they should just let her have her way, she doesn't worry about money, and usually leaves any messes to the organizations legal teams to clean up, especially anything she did while on drugs. She almost never gives anyone her real name, most often opting for the "Rose Keres" alias ("Keres" being the name for greek goddesses of death).

Sarah was born Sarah Davis and grew up in a very religious household alongside her twin sister, Ella, with an abusive father. Her mother commit suicide when she was around 6. She was always rebellious, to an extreme, smoking or drinking, constantly running off to do something to take her mind off of life. Whenever her father got violent, which was common, she would do her best not to cry, to intentionally spite him, not give him what he wanted. Once she was old enough to leave, she did, without telling her dad anything, basically just disappearing from his life - but not before setting the house on fire as she left. After they left, both Sarah and her sister changed their names - Sarah Davis becoming Sarah Hayes and Ella Davis becoming Ella Carter. Because of this upbringing, she became very prone to violence and rebellion, especially out of pure spite. She thinks her father deserves to rot in hell and considers her mother a coward.
