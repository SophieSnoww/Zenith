# Worldbuilding

I think having a whole world around the Zenith Collective and creating lore and such is a fun worldbuilding project, so this is my doc for worldbuilding and brainstorming :thumbsup:

## Brainstorming

- cyberpunk-ish megacity
- arcane city & undercity type of dichotomy
  - well-off city is more solarpunk, everything is good
  - the rest of the city is much more dystopian cyberpunk, though some parts are worse than others
- what i originally wanted to be zephyrs outpost could be a transmission tower
  - this would also work really well if i wanted to go with the idea that zephyr and i are in contact and try to play up the "its real" side of things
  - why would they have the money and whatever available to have a massive outpost completely alone on a moon 1 million lightyears away
    - same question with just their normal building. how do they have that
