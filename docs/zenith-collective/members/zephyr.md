Zephyr is a red, white, and black deer. They're the founder of the Zenith Collective. In the collective, they run a lot of the backend - handling anything from server hosting to event coordination.

## Aesthetics and Inspiration

Zephyr themself struggles with finding a specific aesthetic niche for themselves and instead tends to create whatever catches their interest. They sometimes associate with more indie vibes, artists like [underscores](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HfUJxeVTgrvhk0eWHFzV7) and [Rav](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oeSQ4qmDQ7n89Rdt6tLLn), but have no specific aesthetic.
