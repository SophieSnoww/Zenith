## Art

I have no original art of Anansi, and while I do have inspiration art, I don't want to display it here as if it's her, because it isn't. If you want to see it as a reference for whatever, let me know and I'll send it. In leiu of that, though, here are some graphics I made that sortof showcase the vibes:
