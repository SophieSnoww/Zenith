Cambium is an alien wolf with lime green accents. They enjoy cultivating plants and creating art - in both audio and visual mediums. They are never seen without their gas mask.

## Aesthetics and Inspiration

Aesthetically, Cambium tends to use a solarpunk-dystopia style, overgrown architecture and pristine gardens fallen into ruins and overtaken by the plants once grown there. They make minimal drum and bass with ambient and noise influences.
