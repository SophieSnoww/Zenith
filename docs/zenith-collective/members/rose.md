# Rose Keres

- Wolf
- 32 y/o
- She/her
- Assassin & bodyguard
- Cocaine and murder enthusiast

Rose is a blue/gray wolf. She started out working as a bodyguard for the collective, but has gradually turned into a member. She uses drugs relatively heavily, her favorite being a drug called Lumina, which alters vision and gives intense feelings of euphoria. She has a red karambit she named Thanatos that she keeps on her at all times.

## Aesthetics and Inspiration

Rose makes overdriven, shout-y rap and intense ear-splitting noise music. Much of her art has acid-like aesthetics and blood or drug references.
