# Zenith Collective

*Everything in this document is subject to change as I attempt to make up my mind.*

The Zenith Collective (name subject to change) is a fictional artist collective made up of various characters of mine. I will be completely honest in saying that I take a lot of inspiration from [Emma Essex](https://heckscaper.com), the stuff they make is fucking awesome. I want to find my own artistic identity, not just steal theirs - but they, along with other artists like [Astro](https://astrossoundhell.neocities.org/) and to a smaller extent [Rico](https://rico.neocities.org/pipedream/), are a huge inspiration for me. So here I am, making my own weird furry music collective.

## Overview

The Zenith Collective is a group of artists (musical or otherwise) founded by Zephyr. It places a heavy emphasis on artistic freedom and aesthetics.

## Members

### Zephyr Snow

Zephyr is a red, white, and black deer, and the founder of the collective. They mostly manage things, and are functionally tech support a lot of the time, hosting websites and servers and getting other members' music released. Zephyr doesn't have a singular common aesthetic, but enjoys anything. They're particularly interested in weird or niche art, but musically, they tend to listen to indie and relatively normal genres.

### Sylas Sterling

Sylas is a gray [mantled beast](https://mantledbeasts.carrd.co/). He focuses mostly on technical and weird art projects, such as data corruption as an art form, modular synthesizers, old and deprecated software, recording and sampling EMF frequencies, and using hardware to acheive "authentic" aesthetics like putting a video on a VHS tape and recording the VCR output. He makes technical music, focusing on [Frums](https://soundcloud.com/frums)-like genre fusion.

### Carmen Devereaux

Carmen is a blue-gray husky, and works as a programmer remotely while travelling around and camping. She focuses on softer, calmer aesthetics, such as lo-fi music and ambient recordings.

### Anansi

Anansi is a spider and hacktivist, with knowledge of computer networking and offsec. Aesthetically, she focuses on rave and EDM, and almost sparkledog-esque neon colors and accessories. She makes rave, hardcore/rawstyle, and drum & bass style music.

### Cambium

Cambium is a gray, wolf-like alien with neon accents. They enjoy cultivating plants and graffiti (legal or otherwise), and lean towards solarpunk dystopia and sci-fi aesthetics. They make minimal drum & bass music, with noise and ambient influences.

### Esper

Esper is a brown and gray goat. She focuses on fantasy-like aesthetics, with almost traumacore-like themes. She makes glitchy ambient music and intense, fast-paced dark breakcore.

### Rose Keres

Rose Keres is a blue and gray wolf. Aesthetically she tends to go for formal-but-unhinged vibes, and includes elements of acid and intense LSD-like visuals. She makes intense rap and electronic (almost cyberpunk) music, with occasional metal influences.
