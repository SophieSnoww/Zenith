# Zenith Collective

*Everything in this document is subject to change as I attempt to make up my mind.*

The Zenith Collective (name subject to change) is a fictional artist collective made up of various characters of mine. I will be completely honest in saying that I take a lot of inspiration from [Emma Essex](https://heckscaper.com), the stuff they make is fucking awesome. I want to find my own artistic identity, not just steal theirs - but they, along with other artists like [Astro](https://astrossoundhell.neocities.org/) and to a smaller extent [Rico](https://rico.neocities.org/pipedream/), are a huge inspiration for me. So here I am, making my own weird furry music collective.

## Overview

The Zenith Collective is a group of artists (musical or otherwise) founded by Zephyr. It places a heavy emphasis on artistic freedom and aesthetics.

## Members

### Zephyr Snow

Zephyr is a red, white, and black deer, and the founder of the collective. They mostly manage things, and are functionally tech support a lot of the time, hosting websites and servers and getting other members' music released. Zephyr doesn't have a singular common aesthetic, but enjoys anything. They're particularly interested in weird or niche art.

### Sylas Sterling

Sylas is a gray [mantled beast](https://mantledbeasts.carrd.co/). He focuses mostly on technical and weird art projects, such as data corruption as an art form, modular synthesizers, old and deprecated software, recording and sampling EMF frequencies, and using hardware to acheive "authentic" aesthetics like putting a video on a VHS tape and recording the VCR output. He makes technical music, focusing on [Frums](https://soundcloud.com/frums)-like genre fusion.
