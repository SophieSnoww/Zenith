## Misc. Ideas

- Card that makes everyone move and then you have to make whoever has your titan & agenda win
- Minigame at the start to pick agendas & titans?
  - Roll dice, pick in order from highest -> lowest
  - Then get a random agenda
  - Players can swap agendas before the game
  - Players cannot switch titans
- Armies/minions
- Swap two peoples agendas
- Only two types of cards, permanents & nonpermanents
  - Trinkets and actions
  - You can give other players trinkets
    - Some trinkets have negative effects
- Titans with two different sides? Like MTG werewolf cards
- Even cards

## Gameplay Loop

- Maximum hand size is ~10
- Starting hand size is ~3-4

### Combat

- You can discard a card to subtract its value from the damage being dealt

## Cards

- Very MTG un style cards
- Two numbers
  - One is the cost to play
  - One is the value given

### Archetypes
