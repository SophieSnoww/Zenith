## Misc. Ideas

- Card that makes everyone move and then you have to make whoever has your titan & agenda win
- Minigame at the start to pick agendas & titans?
  - Roll dice, pick in order from highest -> lowest
  - Then get a random agenda
  - Players can swap agendas before the game
  - Players cannot switch titans
- Armies/minions
- Swap two peoples agendas
- Only two types of cards, permanents & nonpermanents
  - Relics and actions
  - You can give other players relics
    - Some relics have negative effects
- Titans with two different sides? Like MTG werewolf cards
- Even cards

## Gameplay Loop

- Maximum hand size is ~10
- Starting hand size is ~3-4

### Combat

- You can discard a card to subtract its value from the damage being dealt

## Cards

- Very MTG un style cards
- Two numbers
  - One is the cost to play
  - One is the value given

## Mana

- Hearthstone mana
  - 1 mana turn 1
  - 2 mana turn 2
  - etc etc
  - Up to 5
    - Titan, Relics, etc. can change this
- You can discard cards for more mana

## Titans

- Each Titan has levels that do different things
  - The points a player has determines the Titans level
- Each Titan has its own maximum mana
