## Episode 1

### Timelapse Script
I do want to talk about how this first episode has been a bit weird, pacing-wise. I felt like I had to start this first episode off and explain a bunch of things, so the first half, or like, two-thirds, of the video, is just me talking a bunch. But now that everything has gotten started, and the series introduction and whatever is out of the way, hopefully things will speed up. Videos will be more of me actually getting things done, rather than just talking about it, like.. most of this episode was. We'll have to see how everything actually pans out, though. I might settle on a different editing style, or whatever. For now, though, that's the plan!
