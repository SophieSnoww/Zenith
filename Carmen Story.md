The whole car jerked as it hit a pot hole. Carmen was doing her best to avoid them, but from driving on plenty of dirt roads in the past, she knows they're unavoidable. It doesn't make them any less jolting, though.
The gentle pitter-patter of the rain on the car roof was calming. Carmen drove slowly along the road that was quickly becoming mud, but soon enough she pulled off of the road, onto a familiar, untraveled side road. It only took a few minutes for her to get where she wanted, a nice little clearing, up the hill from a stream and with a gorgeous view of the Frehya mountain range. She stopped and leaned back in her seat, letting the car idle for a few moments and listening to the rain. She knew the rain would only get worse, though, and after taking a deep breath she opened the door and stepped outside.
She couldn't help but enjoy the cool night air and light rain for a few moments. She stared up at the starry sky, the clouds just thin enough to see all the stars. As if nudging her into action, the rain picked up a little, and she took another deep breath before opening the trunk of her car. It wasn't very big, but she had just enough room to fit everything she needed.
